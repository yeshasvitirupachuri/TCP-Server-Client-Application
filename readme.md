### Code Progress

- [x] Create a new C++ application : [tcp_test_application](./tcp_test_application)
- [x] Add initial CMake to build the original files
- [x] Run the original test application
- [x] Address the TODOs of the server code
- [x] Write a simple command line client application that connects to the server, sends a message and disconnects
- [x] Add the tcp client application to the project build
- [ ] Update server to handle multiple clients through multi-threading
- [ ] Understand how to use docker related part of the test

### Original Instructions

 1) write modern CMake for this project
 2) there are a number of TODO's in the code for error handling, please fill them in
 3) write a simple command line client that connects, sends a message and disconnects
 4) add this tcp client to the build system
 5) add anything you see fit and we'll discuss the reasoning for it

optionally: make the server threaded for multiple clients
